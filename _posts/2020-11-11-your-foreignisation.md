## What is that?

If you google the term _foreignisation_, you will find out that this word is
used to name a translation style. Regardless of the context, it is possible to
make a comparison to what I am gonna put out in this post.

Translation work is much more than just converting words from a language into
another by looking them up in a dictionary. I have taken [this text from the
web][foreignization 1]:

> "Every morning, I walk through the nearby forest to pick up the cherries on
> the ground."
> 
> Cherries are not common in Brazil, so in a domestic approach the translator
> could translate “cherries” into “pitangas” (a very Brazilian fruit) without
> any content loss, prioritizing the target culture and audience. In the
> foreignizing approach “cherries” would be literally translated into “cerejas”
> (cherries in Portuguese) although most Brazilians never saw a cherry tree.
> The cultural gap would outweigh the audience's culture in the translator's
> preference.

[Another text from the web][foreignization 2] that gives us a more disgested
definition:

> [...] translators divided into two translation groups: those who opted for
> foreignisation and those who supported domestication.
>
> The best distinguished difference between these two main translation
> strategies was made by Lawrence Venuti, who explained that “you can bring the
> author back home” or just “sending the reader abroad”.

Many of you out there are just like me: you have decided at some point to leave
your country of birth. Many others might have already returned, or are still
dreaming about it, and maybe a few are packing just right now (few because...
well, this text was written within corona times).

The word _your_ in the term is probably the most important because it is indeed
very personal. Your foreignisation, which are composed of the steps you've taken
in the past and the ones you will take in the future, is highly attached to you,
to your goals, to your feelings, to your experiences, to the opportunities that
were offered to you, your choices... it is **your path**.

Moving to a new country sounds exciting and many are jealous of me, but they
don't realize that the entire thing is also:

> A process of losing your identity.

Buhhh! Get out of the stage! This is so negative! Okay... let's enforce ourselves
to be positive. Nevertheless, positiveness is all the world is about right now,
isn't it?

Let's so say your foreignisation is:

> A process of rebuilding your identity.

## Come on, what are talking about?

First of all, let me introduce myself.

The very first thing you need to know about me is: everybody calls me <span
class="nickname">{{ site.author.nickname }}</span> (well, except my dad). I am a
Brazilian software developer currently living in Berlin. I am 31. I am exactly
from São Paulo city; a huge metropole. My background is Physics and I somehow
got very much interested in software. I started learning it during my Bachelor
degree. I love music, especially rock. I spend a lot of my free time playing my
acoustic guitar. I am also into cycling, chess, photography, skating, tattoos. I
enjoy getting drunk sometimes.  Recently I have become more interested in
history as well (not unexpected for someone living in Berlin).  Ahh... you will
hardly be able to square me in any well known standard stereotype.  Living in
Germany (more exactly in Berlin) was a dream.

Having this all, you start understanding my path. It is important to know who I
am since this post is a result of my so-far-foreignisation.

## Okay... so, is it bad?

Don't get me wrong! Putting yourself in a such challenge requires a lot of
courage and brings remarkable experiences.

The point is hard to explain. So, let's ask the expats: your foreignisation is
being harder than you expected, or am I mistaking? At least mine is being **much
harder** than I expected.

Another detail: once you did it, there is no turn back. There is the song [My
My Hey Hey from Neil Young][my my hey hey song]:

> Once you're gone, you can never come back<br/>
> When you're out of the blue and into the black

Back to 2015, I and my dad were talking about these very same lyrics, and I
still remember like it was yesterday he telling me his interpretation of this
sentence:

> It is just like when you read a book. Once you did it, you cannot unread it.
> You are now yourself plus this book.

Well, moving to a country with a different culture changes you. I mean... a lot.

Have you noticed I am using "country of birth" instead of "home country"? Why?
For the expats I ask: which is your home country? Where is your home? Is it hard
to find an answer?  What kind of feelings did you have while trying to find it?

It is hard to describe your foreignisation with words. It is a feeling you have
in there. On some days you are feeling a stranger, in other days you feel like
conquering the world.

Each time I was in Brazil, I was happy, I felt just back home... but not really.
After some days I was wishing to be back home. What you have here, you don't
have there. What you don't have here, you have there.

## So, what then?

I don't wanna bring any bad mood to anyone. If you do consider moving, don't
think too much about the negative parts, otherwise, you might give up.

Just pack, go, enjoy, and be proud of your achievements. Great things will
happen to you! Just be aware that there will be hard times... it is normal. Be
resilient, you can go through it!

I hope this open letter helps you :)
