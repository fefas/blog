## The TDD series

As this is the first post of my TDD series, let's explain the idea behind it.

So far, I created three posts which tells about my relation with two terms well
spread in our craft: _Clean Code_ and _TDD_. However, these posts cover those
themes in an abstract way and now I feel myself forced to create concret content
as well.

My idea is to show step-by-step how I use TDD to code, but to explain it as I
want to do, it is needed first cover some therical stuff and have some
definitions and it is a lot of content that will not fit in one post.

For this reason I decided to create this TDD series and the first part will
cover the _levels of testing_ I find import to define. I don't know yet how many
post it will be in the end. So, let's see where we will get :)
