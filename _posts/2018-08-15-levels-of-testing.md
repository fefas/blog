So far, I've created three posts explaning my relation with some well-spread
terms in our craft, such as _Clean Code_, _Software Craftman_, _TDD_ etc.
However, I covered them only abstractly. At this moment, I feel myself forced
to create concret content to support those opinions and expose my ideas.

The problem is: to achieve this goal in the way I want, it will require much
content.. for sure, more than one post.

Why that? Two main reasons:

1. Theoretical stuff must be defined
2. Growing a software is an iteract learning-process

The idea is to create a serie of posts within I want to share a step-by-step how
testing can guide the code and let the design to come up. This serie, which I
called _TDD in the real life_, will show how I use TDD for daily coding.

I use some few excelent books as reference which changed completely the way I
do software. You should, of course, study them to have a bigger picture.

Since I have more experience writing APIs in PHP, we are going to build an API
in PHP. For running the environment,
TODO I want to bring those topics closer to Web-PHP-docker community

In case you are wondering I have already planed all episodes.. no, I have to
disappoint you. I well cover topics such as Level of testing, testing behaviour,
test doubles, walking skeleton, TDD cycle
