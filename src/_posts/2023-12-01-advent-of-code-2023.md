## Getting back to C++

I just came to know all this advent calender thingy on my second christmas after
moving to the north hemisphere. In this about to end year of 2023 I got finally
introduced to the [advent of code] by my current team mate [@malukenho].

As he is interested in learning C++ and I am willing to get back to the language
after many years away from it, we are solving [leetcode] basically everyday in
C++ and decided to team up and also use it to solve the advent of code 2023 with
the idea of publishing our progress in our blogs. So, [check out his post] to
follow his progress.

Finally, you can check out my progress by the calendar bellow:


|      |      |      |      |      |  01  |  02  |
|  03  |  04  |  05  |  06  |  07  |  08  |  09  |
|  10  |  11  |  12  |  13  |  14  |  15  |  16  |
|  17  |  18  |  19  |  20  |  21  |  22  |  23  |
|  24  |  25  |  26  |  27  |  28  |  29  |  30  |
|  30  |  31  |      |      |      |      |      |

All the code will be publised in github at [fefas/advent-of-code-2023]. For the
solutions, I will be using TDD in order to solve the challenges... of course, what
would you expect from me?
