## Getting back to C++

I just came to know all this advent calender thingy during my second christmas
living in the north hemisphere. In this about to end year of 2023, I finally got
introduced to the [advent of code] by my current team mate [@malukenho].

As we are both interested in learning (or relearning) C++ and have been solving
[leetcode] everyday using it, we decided to team up and solve the advent of code
2023 in this languange together with the idea of publishing our progress onto
our blogs.

So, check out [@malukenho's progress] at his blog and mine bellow:

|      |      |      |      |      | [01] | [02] |
| [03] | [04] |  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |
|  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |
|  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |  **  |
|  **  |  **  |

All the code will be publised at [github.com/fefas/advent-of-code-2023]. In
order to solve the challenges, I will be using TDD... of course, what would you
expect from me? :D

I gotta say that TDD is not the most fittable approach to solve this kind of
problem, specially because this code will never change once it finishes and,
therefore, no real benefit will come out of the extra time invested when
developing. Anyway, TDD will help me (1) find my way around C++, (2) write my
first tests in the language, and (3) create some content on the topic which
might be useful for some starters.
